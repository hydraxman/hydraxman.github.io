# Qwen3.8-27B

Following the widespread community adoption of the Qwen3.5 and Qwen3.6 series, we are pleased to introduce Qwen3.8, the most capable generation in the Qwen open-model family to date.

Built on the architectural foundation of Qwen3.5, Qwen3.8 delivers substantial gains across coding, professional work, research, and long-horizon agentic tasks. Qwen3.8-27B brings these advances to a compact, deployment-friendly dense model: a native vision-language model that understands images and videos, with flexible thinking control, designed to carry complex, multi-step tasks through to completion with greater reliability.

## Qwen3.8 Highlights

Qwen3.8-27B features the following enhancements:
- **Core Capabilities**: Comprehensive improvements across coding, professional work, research, and long-horizon agentic tasks.
- **Agent Execution**: Stronger autonomous planning and better handling of environment feedback, leading to more reliable end-to-end task completion.
- **Downstream Compatibility**: Broader support for popular harnesses and development tools, making it easier to integrate into your existing stack.
- **Flexible Thinking Control**: Thinking mode is on by default and can be disabled per request; reasoning depth can be tuned with `reasoning_effort`, and reasoning context from historical messages is retained via `preserve_thinking`.
- **Vision-Language Understanding**: Native support for image and video understanding, from STEM diagrams and documents to hour-scale videos.

## Best Practices

To achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:

1. **Sampling Parameters**: We suggest using the following sets of sampling parameters:  
    
    - Thinking Mode: `temperature=1.0`, `top_p=0.95`, `top_k=20`, `min_p=0.0`, `presence_penalty=0.0`, `repetition_penalty=1.0`
    - Instruct (or non-thinking) mode: `temperature=0.7`, `top_p=0.80`, `top_k=20`, `min_p=0.0`, `presence_penalty=1.5`, `repetition_penalty=1.0`
    
    For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetition. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.

2. **Adequate Output Length**: To optimize performance on agentic tasks, we recommend allocating sufficient output length to allow the model to generate detailed and comprehensive responses. For frameworks that support separate token limits for internal reasoning and final outputs, we suggest the following configuration within the 1M context length:
    
    - Reasoning Content: Set the maximum output length to 262,144 tokens.
    - Final Response: Set the maximum output length to 131,072 tokens.

    These settings provide the necessary capacity for complex reasoning while ensuring ample space for high-quality final deliverables.

3. **Processing Ultra-Long Texts**: Qwen3.8-27B natively supports context lengths of up to 262,144 tokens. For long-horizon tasks where the total length (including both input and output) exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively, e.g., YaRN.

4. **Long Video Understanding**: To optimize inference efficiency for plain text and images, the `size` parameter in the released `video_preprocessor_config.json` is conservatively configured. It is recommended to set the `longest_edge` parameter in the video_preprocessor_config file to 469,762,048 (corresponding to 224k video tokens) to enable higher frame-rate sampling for hour-scale videos and thereby achieve superior performance. For example,
    ```json
    {"longest_edge": 469762048, "shortest_edge": 4096}
    ```
